# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems.

## Structure

Each day lives in its own folder:

- `day_01/`
- `day_02/`
- `day_03/`
- `...`

Inside each day you’ll typically find:

- `puzzle.py` – solution for part 1 (and sometimes part 2)
- `input.txt` – my personal puzzle input
- `test.txt` – example input from the problem statement (when used)

All solutions are written in Python.

## Running

From a given day’s folder, run:

```bash
python puzzle.py
```

(Or the appropriate script for that day.)

## Notes

This code is intended for learning, experimentation, and fun while working through Advent of Code. It is not optimized for performance unless needed for a particular puzzle.
